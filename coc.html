          House of Elders is a community of adult gamers, mostly parents, who play Xbox. Our main focus is to make the most of, and squeeze the most enjoyment from, the limited game time we have by playing with liked minded friends. We play on Xbox predominantly in the UK or similar time zones. It is adults only, a place away from the little ones where you can kick back and have fun.
      
      What makes this clan great is that it’s our aim to provide an environment where you can find like-minded people and game together in the limited time you have available. Whether that is with a wide variety of people within the clan or just a couple of friends you’ve made over time. As always, our motto is, ‘family first’.

   <h2 class = "CoC-header">Stuff That Rules</h2>
   <ul class = "center-align">
     <li>Must be able to communicate with a good working microphone on organised events.</li>
     <li>Listen and respect your FTL (Fire Team Leader) on organised events.</li>
     <li>Be understanding that you might not have a place in an organised event as sign ups are required. Signing up does not guarantee a spot in a fireteam but we will try to our best to include everyone, fill spots when they become available and field full teams.</li>
     <li>Being active within the clan, playing and communicating with other clan members, either in-game or on Slack.</li>
     <li>We want the Clan to be a helpful and active community so ask that members are active to a reasonable degree. Inactivity of a month (unless the Admins are notified) can cause your clan tag to be revoked.</li>

<div>
    <h2 class = "CoC-header">Extra Tidbits</h2>
    <ul class = "center-align">
      <li>Sign-up posts for Destiny activities are on our Slack instant messaging platform, so ask for an invite, jump in and get involved. </li>
      <li>Please note that bad language may be used, so when using a Kinect or Blended chat, give your fireteam a heads up so they know to watch their language.</li>
      <li>The Code of Conduct is reviewed and updated over time. It is your responsibility to check back and keep updated with the code and any changes</li>
      <li>Finally, Admins are around to listen and to help resolve any issues you may have with either the clan, another clan member or one of the Admin team. You can contact us in a number of ways, via the Bungie.net – House of Elders forum via direct message, the ‘admin-help’ channel on our clan Slack, a direct message on Slack or Xbox live.</li>
